The eigenvalues of large matrices are of interest for a large variety of use cases.
Their calculation however grows increasingly complex with increasing matrix sizes.
Therefore, we seek to simplify this process by approximating functionals over the spectrum of a matrix.
This thesis is focussed on the spectral density or Denisty of States (DoS) among those.
It has already been applied to real symmetric matrices.
This work aims to go one step further and apply the findings to unitary matrices with the help of the cayley transform.
