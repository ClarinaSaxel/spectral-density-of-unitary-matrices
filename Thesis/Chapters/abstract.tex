The eigenvalues of large matrices are of interest in a large variety of use cases.
However, their computation becomes increasingly challenging as matrix size grows.
This thesis focuses on the investigation of functionals over the eigenvalues of unitary matrices,
with particular emphasis on the spectral density, or density of states (DoS) among those.
While established methods exist for real symmetric matrices,
this work extends these approaches to unitary matrices with the help of the Cayley transform.
The aim is to develop and analyze efficient techniques for approximating spectral functionals in this broader context.
