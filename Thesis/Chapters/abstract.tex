The eigenvalues of large matrices are of interest for a large variety of use cases.
Their calculation however grows increasingly complex with increasing matrix sizes.
Therefore, we seek to simplify this process by approximating functionals over the spectrum of a matrix.
This thesis is focussed on the spectral density or Denisty of States (DoS) among those.
